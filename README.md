# SpaceAce

A fancy immutable storage library for JavaScript

## Status

Some code exists, but is very much a WIP. Docs/API not yet finalized. Any feedback or ideas are welcome!

## Goal

To be as powerful and useful as Redux, but more modular with an easier to use API.

## Background

It's become standard practice in front-end JavaScript to have views that receive data via a one-way data flow. This was popularized by React and Flux/React. The idea is that the view components contain no state. Instead, they receive their data via properties given by parent components, which ultimately is given data from a single data store. This store's _state_ object is immutable. Instead of being changed, it's replaced with a slightly altered copy, and the new state is passed down through the components. This state is generated by a function known as a _reducer_. The reducer receives an action, and based on the action it takes the existing state and generates a new one. This new state is then passed to the view components, triggering a re-render of them.

This concept, referred to as _Flux_ has many advantages:

- It's much easier to reason through the changes your application experiences.
- You can easily log changes.
- You can even replay/undo state changes (useful when debugging).
- Has great libraries such as _Redux_ to help you get started.

That all sounds nice but it has its problems:

- It's not clear which parts of the store are relevant to each view component.
- It's hard to architect the application code around this concept. People often put all their actions in a single `actions.js`, and end up with a giant reducer in `reducer.js`. This goes against the goal of keeping all the code relevant to a component in a single file.
- This pattern results in a lot of boilerplate code. Actions are defined in one file, referenced multiple times in the same file, and then referenced in the app reducer. It'd be nice to define an action once, in the component that uses it, and then just call it.

If you never used Redux and didn't understand that, don't worry, you don't need to with
SpaceAce.

## Example Usage

SpaceAce can be used with any front-end view library (in theory), but the examples below are done with React.

**index.js**
```jsx
import react from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Space from 'spaceace';
import Container from './Container';

// Create the root "space" along with its initial state
const rootSpace = new Space({ name: 'Jon', todoList: { todos: [] } });
rootSpace.subscribe(causedBy => {
  // Example `causedBy`s:
  // 'todoList#addTodo', 'todos[akd4a1plj]#toggleDone'
  console.log(`Re-render of <Container /> caused by ${causedBy}`);
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Container space={rootSpace} />,
    document.getElementById('react-container')
  );
});
```

**Container.js**
```jsx
import react from 'react';
import TodoList from './TodoList';

export default function Container({ space }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome {state.name}</h1>
      <TodoList
        // Create/Get child space that uses/takes over `state.todoList`
        space={space.subSpace('todoList')}
        name={state.name}
      />
    </div>
   );
```

**TodoList.js**
```jsx
import react from 'react';
import uuid from 'uuid/v4';
import Todo from 'Todo';

export default function TodoList({ space, name }) {
  const { todos } = space.state;

  return(
    <h2>{name}'s Todos:</h2>
    <button onClick={space.setState(addTodo)}>Add Todo</button>
    <ul className='todos'>
      {todos.map(todo =>
        <Todo space={space.subSpace('todos', todo.id)} />
      )}
    </ul>
  );
};

// setState callbacks are given the space first, then the event, if it exists.
// The object that is returned is merged with the space's state
// In this case the `todos` attribute is overwritten
function addTodo({ space }, e) {
  const { todos } = space.state;

  e.preventDefault();

  return {
    todos: [
      // subSpace(…) creates a space for the todo, with an initial state
      // All spaces that exist in a list, like this one, need a unique 'id'
      // uuid() is used to generate a unique 'id'
      space.subSpace({ id: uuid(), msg: 'A new TODO', done: false })
     ].concat(todos)
   };
 }
}
```

**Todo.js**
```jsx
import react from 'react';

export default function Todo({ space }) {
  const todo = space.state; // The entire state is the todo
  const { setState } = space;
  const doneClassName = todo.done ? 'done' : '';

  return(
    <li className='todo'>
      <input type='checkbox' checked={done} onChange={setState(toggleDone)} />
      <span className={doneClassName}>{todo.msg}</span>
      <button onClick={setState(removeTodo)}>Remove Todo</button>
    </li>
  );
};

// The returned value from an action is merged onto the existing state
// In this case, only the `done` attribute is changed on the todo
function toggleDone({ state: todo }, e) {
  return { done: !todo.done };
}

function removeTodo(todoSpace, e) {
  e.preventDefault();

  // Returning null to setState causes this space to be removed from its parent
  // In this case, this causes this todo to be removed from the parent's list
  // of todos
  return null;
}
```

## Documentation

### What is a Space?

`Space` is the default class provided by the `spaceace` npm package.

Every `space` consists of:
- `state`: An immutable state, which can only be overwritten using an action.
- `subscribe`: A method for subscribing to updates.
- `setState`: A method for changing a space's state. Accepts an object or function.
- `subSpace`: A method for spawning or attaching child spaces.

You create a new space by calling `new Space(…)` e.g.
```javascript
const rootSpace = new Space({ initialState: true, todoList: { todos: [] } });
```

### state

`state` is a getter method on every space. It generates a frozen/immutable object
that can be used to render a view. It includes the state of any child spaces as well.

### subscribe

Registers a callback function to be called whenever the space's state is updated.
This includes if a child space's state is updated.

It calls the subscriber with a single parameter: `causedBy`, which specifies why
the subscriber was invoked. It's useful for debugging purposes. The format of
`causedBy` is `spaceName#functionName`.

e.g.
```jsx
userSpace.subscribe(causedBy => {
  console.log('Re-rendered by: ', causedBy);
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Component {...userSpace} />,
    document.getElementById('react-container')
  );
});
```

### setState

Given an object, `setState` merges it into the space's state. If the object contains
any other spaces, they become children of `setState`'s space. Pass in a second parameter
to give the update a name, for logging purposes.

Given a function, `setState` wraps it and returns a function that will take the
returned object of the original function and merge it onto the space's state.

The function is called with the space as a parameter. This often saves you from
needing to bind `this` to your event handlers.

If `null` is returned from a space that is a list item, then the space is removed
from the list it is in.

`setState` is generally called with a function when being passed to an event handler,
the event is passed in as the second parameter, useful for calling `preventDefault()`
or for figuring out the key that was pressed for keyboard events.

e.g. Given the following React component:
```jsx
class SignupModal extends React.Component {
  closeModal(space, e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    return { isOpen: false };
  }

  toggleMinify({ state }, e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    return { isMinified: !state.isMinified };
  }

  render() {
    const { state, setState, subSpace } = this.props;
    return (
      <Modal isOpen={state.isOpen}>
        <SignupForm {...subSpace('signupForm')} />
        <a href='#' onClick={setState(this.closeModal)}>&times;</a>
        <a href='#' onClick={setState(this.toggleMinify)}>
          {state.isMinified ? 'Expand' : 'Shrink'}
        </a>
      </Modal>
    )
  }
}
```

### subSpace

One of the main feature of SpaceAce is the ability to break up a store into individual sub-stores, or spaces. Any space, whether it's a root or a child, can _spawn_ or _attach_ spaces to themselves.

When a child space's state is updated, it notifies its parent space, which in turn updates its state (which includes the child's state), and so on.

#### Spawning Children

Calling `subSpace` with a string as the only parameter will turn that attribute
of a space into a child space.

e.g. Given a space called `userSpace` with this state:
```javascript
{
  name: 'Jon',
  settings: {
    nightMode: true,
    fontSize: 12
  }
}
```

You can convert the `settings` into a child space with `userSpace.subSpace('settings')`.

Note that even though `settings` is now a space, the state of `userSpace` hasn't changed.
At least not until the `settings` space is updated with a change.

#### Attaching Children

If there isn't an existing part of a space's state that can be converted, you can
create a new space (with an initial state) and attach it to its parent's state.
This is very useful when you create spaces that go into a list.

e.g. Given a `userSpace` with this state:
```javascript
{
  name: 'Jon',
  comments: []
}
```

You can add new comment _spaces_ to the parent space with the following setState call:
```javascript
userSpace.setState({
  comments: userSpace.state.comments.concat(userSpace.subSpace({
    message: 'This is a new comment',
    id: uuid()
  })
});
```
